NCAA D1 Men's Lacrosse stats 2023 and analysis


This research explores the multifaceted factors influencing team success in NCAA Division I Men’s Lacrosse during the 2023 season, using a comprehensive dataset of performance metrics. The study is structured around three central research questions that examine the contributions of offensive output, possession control, and defensive efficiency to overall team success.
The first question investigates how offensive performance—measured by metrics such as average goals, assists, shooting percentage, man-up offense efficiency, and points per game—correlates with team outcomes like win-loss percentage and scoring margin. Sub-analyses consider the specific contributions of goals versus assists, the role of shooting efficiency, and offensive differences between high- and low-performing teams.
The second question focuses on possession-related metrics including faceoff wins, ground balls, and clearing percentages. This analysis seeks to understand whether a higher volume of possessions leads to greater scoring output and improved win rates, and how successful transitions from defense to offense impact overall performance.
The third question evaluates defensive impact using statistics such as goals allowed, saves, caused turnovers, and man-down defense efficiency. It aims to identify which defensive factors most effectively reduce opponent scoring and enhance team resilience.
Together, these research areas aim to deliver a holistic understanding of the key statistical drivers of success in collegiate lacrosse, offering valuable insights into the game’s strategic dynamics.


Objectives:
Determine the correlation between average per-game statistics and game outcomes in NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse.
Assess the impact of offensive performance, defensive performance, and possession volume on team success.
Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis.


Methodology:
Data Source: NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse 2023 season statistics from the SCORE Sports Data Repository. Here is the website link to my dataset: https://data.scorenetwork.org/lacrosse/lacrosse_ncaa_div1.html
Analytical Tools: Multiple linear regression analyses to identify statistically significant predictors of team success. 
Visualization: Tableau dashboards to explore and illustrate relationships between variables and win percentages.


Key Findings: 
Below is the research and visual for offensive performance: 
Key: Color is based on shooting percentage which is the percentage of shots that hit the goal during the game (lighter = not effecient, darker = very effecient).
Size of circles is based on average golas per game (smaller = less goals, larger = more goals).

Below is the research and visual for defensive performance:
Key: Color is based on average caused turnovers per game (lighter = not effecient, darker = very effecient).
Size of circles is based on man down defense success percentage (smaller = not effecient, larger = very effecient).

Below is the research and visual for volume of possessions:
Key: Color is based on clearing percentage (lighter = not effecient, darker = very effecient).
Size of circles is based on number of face off wins (smaller = less wins, bigger = more wins).

Recommendations:
Based on our findings, I would recommended teams to be well rounded in every aspect of lacrosse, but specifically with shooting percentage and clearing percentage. I would implement and clear that will consitently work and spend more time on it during practices. Also, for shooting perecentage I would have offensive players shoot for the first 15-30 minutes of practice, therefore it will result with more shots on goal during the game.
With these changes in practice, it will result in a lacrosse team winning more lacrosse games during a season.
