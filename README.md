This research explores the multifaceted factors influencing team success in NCAA Division I Men’s Lacrosse during the 2023 season, using a comprehensive dataset of performance metrics. The study is structured around three central research questions that examine the contributions of offensive output, possession control, and defensive efficiency to overall team success.
The first question investigates how offensive performance—measured by metrics such as average goals, assists, shooting percentage, man-up offense efficiency, and points per game—correlates with team outcomes like win-loss percentage and scoring margin. Sub-analyses consider the specific contributions of goals versus assists, the role of shooting efficiency, and offensive differences between high- and low-performing teams.
The second question focuses on possession-related metrics including faceoff wins, ground balls, and clearing percentages. This analysis seeks to understand whether a higher volume of possessions leads to greater scoring output and improved win rates, and how successful transitions from defense to offense impact overall performance.
The third question evaluates defensive impact using statistics such as goals allowed, saves, caused turnovers, and man-down defense efficiency. It aims to identify which defensive factors most effectively reduce opponent scoring and enhance team resilience.
Together, these research areas aim to deliver a holistic understanding of the key statistical drivers of success in collegiate lacrosse, offering valuable insights into the game’s strategic dynamics.
